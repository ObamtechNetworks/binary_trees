# Binary Trees Project
### Overview
This project focuses on implementing and manipulating binary trees in the C programming language. The project aims to enhance the understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms related to binary trees. In a team of two, focus is to accomplish various tasks, ranging from creating basic binary trees to implementing more advanced structures like Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, and Max Binary Heaps.

# General
- Understand the concept of a binary tree and its components.
- Differentiate between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree (BST).
- Analyze the potential gain in time complexity compared to linked lists.
- Comprehend the terms depth, height, and size of a binary tree.
- Implement different traversal methods to navigate through a binary tree.
- Identify characteristics of a complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary tree.

# Data Structures
- Gain proficiency in using basic binary tree structures.
- Understand and implement Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, and Max Binary Heaps.

# Project Structure
The project involves multiple tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of binary trees. It is essential to follow the provided structure and include necessary data structures in the header file. The project tasks range from creating new nodes to handling more complex structures like BSTs, AVL Trees, and Max Binary Heaps.
